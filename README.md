# Poem Pop AR
Dive into a world where poetry meets play, and every word is a pop of inspiration!

## Unity version
2022.3.22f1

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind "Poem Pop AR" stemmed from our love for poetry and the desire to merge it with the immersive experience of augmented reality. We wanted to create a unique and interactive way for people to engage with poetry in a modern, tech-savvy world

## What it does
"Poem Pop AR" is an application that combines Gemini AI-generated poetry with augmented reality gameplay. Users can generate a unique poem using Gemini AI, and then collect words scattered in the AR environment using their device's camera. And collect as many words as possible before time runs out

## How we built it
We built "Poem Pop AR" using a combination of Gemini AI Rest API for poetry generation word finding within the poem, and AR technology for word scattering. The application was developed using Unity for the AR functionality and integrated with Gemini AI models for poem generation.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges we faced was integrating the Gemini AI-generated poetry seamlessly into the AR environment while maintaining smooth gameplay performance. We also encountered difficulties optimizing the application for different devices and ensuring compatibility across various platforms.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of successfully combining two distinct concepts— AI-based poetry and AR —in a cohesive and engaging application. Additionally, we're pleased to overcome technical challenges and deliver a polished and immersive experience for users to enjoy.

## What we learned
Through the development of "Poem Pop AR" we gained valuable insights into Gemini AI integration, AR development, and user experience design. We learned how to optimize performance for AR applications and improve gameplay mechanics to create a more enjoyable user experience.

## What's next 
In the future, we plan to expand "Poem Pop AR" with new features such as multiplayer modes, additional poetry styles, and the integration of scoreboards and leaderboards. With multiplayer modes, users can challenge friends or compete against other players in real-time word collection battles. Additionally, the addition of scoreboards and leaderboards will allow users to track their progress, compare scores with friends, and compete for the top spot. These updates will enhance the social and competitive aspects of Poem Pop AR, providing users with even more ways to engage with the app and enjoy the experience.
